# git-sample-repo

### With great power comes great responsibliity

Git is a powerful version control tool. It is heavily used in the software
industry and it is important for you to learn some of the tricks of the trade.
Here we have some staging for a messed up repo (which you have locally), so
please do your best not to muck up master!

#### Bonus Points
1. Create a repo without `release_notes`, this repo should only have 1 commit.
2. Make changes on your repo and have the changes reflected on both repos. However, the new repo should not have old histories.
